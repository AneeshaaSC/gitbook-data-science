## Features

* One way to improve soccer results predictions is definitely to include information about players and their performances. For instance, pull relevant data from whoscored.com \(any other website\) and add another feature that stands for the average performance of 23 players in the last X years.
* Consider the recent matches before the deadline
* Russia is huge and the stadiums are quite spread out. For example, Spain plays in Sochi, Kazan and Kaliningrad.

  Sochi -&gt; Kazan: 2,055 km Kazan -&gt; Kaliningrad: ~2100 km

  That's quite a distance to make. There are 4 days of rest between each games and that makes me wonder, if these distances will have any influence on the teams and their performance, it could be an interesting factor.
