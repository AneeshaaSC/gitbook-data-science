> [t-SNE](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/) is the very popular algorithm to extremely reduce the dimensionality of your data in order to visually present it. It is capable of mapping hundreds of dimensions to just 2 while preserving important data relationships, that is, when closer samples in the original space are closer in the reduced space. t-SNE works quite well for small and moderately sized real-world datasets and does not require much tuning of its hyperparameters. In other words, if youâ€™ve got less than 100,000 points, you will apply that magic black box thing and get a beautiful scatter plot in return.
