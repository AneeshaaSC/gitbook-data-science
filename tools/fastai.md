# fastai

When training using the fast.ai library, it prints out 3 numbers each cycle:

* training loss
* validation loss
* accuracy

If the validation loss is much lower than training loss, the model is under fitting. It means the cycle length is too short - the log pop up before reaching to the bottom.

`precompute = True` is used as a shortcut if the dataset is large as it is much faster - about 10x faster.

data augmentation doesn't work if `precompute = True`. I don't understand why though.

Neural nets really like standardized variables. This can done by setting `do_scale`=`True` when calling `prod_df`.
