# How to be stronger

## Practicing on Kaggle

As [recommended by Jeremy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSFG_W8JxBo&feature=youtu.be&t=38m10s):

> Could you try to capture seasonality and trend effects by creating new columns like average sales in the month of August \[[38:10](https://youtu.be/YSFG_W8JxBo?t=38m10s)\]? It is a great idea. The thing to figure out is how to do it because there are details to get right and are difficult- not intellectually difficult but they are difficult in a way that makes you headbutt your desk at 2am \[[38:41](https://youtu.be/YSFG_W8JxBo?t=38m41s)\].

> Coding you do for machine learning is incredibly frustrating and incredibly difficult. If you get a detail wrong, much of the time it is not going to give you an exception it will just silently be slightly less good than it otherwise would have been. If you are on Kaggle, you will know that you are not doing as well as other people. But otherwise you have nothing to compare against. You will not know if your companyâ€™s model is half as good as it could be because you made a little mistake. This is why practicing on Kaggle now is great.

> Even for Jeremy, there is an extraordinary array of them. As you get to get to know what they are, you will start to know how to check for them as you go. You should assume every button you press, you are going to press the wrong button. That is fine as long as you have a way to find out.

> Unfortunately there is not a set of specific things you should always do, you just have to think what you know about the results of this thing I am about to do.
