The correlations between variables can show if we have collinear varibles, that is, variables that are highly correlated with one another. Often, we want to remove one in a pair of collinear variables because having both variables would be redundant. [Here is the codes](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/introduction-to-manual-feature-engineering#Collinear-Variables).
