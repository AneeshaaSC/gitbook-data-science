## Scaling

[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/preprocessing/plot_all_scaling.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-preprocessing-plot-all-scaling-py):

> Indeed many estimators are designed with the assumption that each feature takes values close to zero or more importantly that all features vary on comparable scales. In particular, metric-based and gradient-based estimators often assume approximately standardized data \(centered features with unit variances\). A notable exception are decision tree-based estimators that are robust to arbitrary scaling of the data.
