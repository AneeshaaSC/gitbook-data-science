# Categorical Variables

> There is some debate about the relative merits of these approaches, and some models can deal with label encoded categorical variables with no issues. [Here is a good Stack Overflow discussion](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/9443/when-to-use-one-hot-encoding-vs-labelencoder-vs-dictvectorizor). I think \(and this is just a personal opinion\) for categorical variables with many classes, one-hot encoding is the safest approach because it does not impose arbitrary values to categories. The only downside to one-hot encoding is that the number of features \(dimensions of the data\) can explode with categorical variables with many categories. To deal with this, we can perform one-hot encoding followed by [PCA](http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/cosc453/student_tutorials/principal_components.pdf) or other [dimensionality reduction methods](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/07/dimension-reduction-methods/) to reduce the number of dimensions \(while still trying to preserve information\).
